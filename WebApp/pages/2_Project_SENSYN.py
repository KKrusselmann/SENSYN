             #### What we do \n 
             
             With project SENSYN, a team of social scientists and data scientists aims to encourage and assist the use of synthetic datasets (a) amongst researchers handling personal and highly sensitive data and (b) for the accessibility of data for the general public. 
             One the one hand, the use of synthetic data is encouraged through a proof-of-concept study synthetic dataset using highly sensitive homicide data from the Netherlands. 
             On the other hand, the project will result in accessible protocols and guidelines for other researchers, as well as online workshops and videos on the use of synthetic data. 
             All outputs of the project, including the synthetic dataset, are available and accessible on this webpage.

             #### Why we do it \n 
             
             Making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) is a pillar of Open Science. Yet, privacy regulations hinder the implementation of FAIR principles in research fields working with sensitive data, such as crime, finances, or public health. Sharing individual-level data is not just crucial for collaborations between research institutions, for enabling replication studies and increase transparency and accountability of research processes, but also to inform policymaking and to engage other stakeholders of the general public in research.
             To overcome the problem of sharing sensitive data, in recent years, the use of differentially private synthetic datasets has emerged as a successful tool to make detailed highly sensitive data more accessible, in particular amongst data scientists. 
             A synthetic dataset is an artificial dataset that has the same statistical properties as the original dataset, but as each datapoint is simulated, they cannot be traced back to individuals protected under privacy regulations. In the context of Open Science, synthetic datasets have been praised for opening new possibilities for the replication of studies and for researchers to share their data under FAIR principles. However, the use of this novel technique is not widespread yet, particularly in the social sciences. 
             In addition, very little attention has been directed at the possibilities of using synthetic datasets to open up research processes and findings to non-academic audiences.
